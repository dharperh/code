       <article>This article is based on my experience as a Launch Code student.  While training in the Launch Code course of study, I have tried to protect my reputation as a smart person; but the jig is up...<p id = "imposter">I am an Imposter.</p></article> 
     <h1>MY LAUNCH CODE JOURNEY</h1>  
    <p>I applied for Launch Code a few months ago and was accepted; 
       Happy Days!  I was so excited!  When I began the course, I was active and vibrant;
       <img src="Picture2.jpg"/>
      ...... just a few months later, my appearance began to change.  The stress and frustration is having a strange affect on me.  Due to all the hours I spend
       on the computer trying to complete assignments, I very closely resemble this--<a href=""></a> 
       <img src="Picture5.jpg"/> .  
        </p>
            
      
       <p> I am not a quitter, so I will continue on, even if it comes to 
       'this' <img src="frustration.gif"/> .</p>


      <p> I have spent numerous hours trying to figure out simple task.  Mostly, I am a very calm
       and easy going person but Launch Code assignments have brought me to the brink of this
       behavior.
       </p>
      
         <p class = "sidebar">SideBar--</b>One of my assignments is to figure out how to use html entities.  I' m going to make this easy on myself.

While traveling across Europe I could spend both &pound (British pound) and &euro; (euro) while in Great Britian.  I still have both &euro; and &pound currency.  
After completing the Launch Code course of study I hope to be able to vacation somewhere with family and friends.</p>


  <h2>WHAT ARE THE AREAS OF STUDY?</h2>

  <p>As a Launch Code student you will learn how to work with Javascript, HTML, CSS, Git, Angular, and Visual Studio.  You will have sample learning projects and assignments
     that will help with building skill sets in the various areas of study.  Instructor trainings will be video taped so that students can review when needed.
  </p>
  <p class = "warning">Warning!!!! Take heed to the drop assignment(s).</p>

         <p class = "sidebar">SideBar-- I have no experience with any of this.  I like a challenge,... but, there is so much to learn and in my case, so little time.</p>

   <h3>INSIGHT ON WHAT TO EXPECT</h3>

  <p>As a student, you can expect to dedicate many hours to study and learning.  How much time depends on whether or not you have prior training
     and/or knowledge of the course offerings.  The instructor training and TA support is very good.  Your success will be determined by your motivation level and the amount of time available for study.  

     Expect to work long and hard.  Anything worth having is worth the effort it will take to attain it.

  </p>

  <h4>HOW WILL THE LAUNCH CODE COURSE BENEFIT ME?</h4>

  <p>The knowledge and training gained is priceless.  You will be equipped to learn other computer languages and gain knowledge to branch off into numerous other
     areas of computer technologies.  Once you have the knowledge it is up to you to find the career path that is right for you.
  </p>

  <p>Good Luck Launch Coder!  Get ready for blast off into a successful future!!!!</p>
