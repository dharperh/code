       <article>This article is based on my experience as a LaunchCode student.  My name is not given to protect my reputation of being smart; but I am an <b>imposter</b>.</article> 
     <h1>WHAT IS IT LIKE LEARNING JAVASCRIPT AT LAUNCHCODE?</h1>  
    I applied for Lauch Code a few months ago and was accepted; 
       Happy Days!  I was so excited!  When I began the course, I was active and vibrant;

      ...... just a few months later, my appearance began to change.  The stress and frustration is having a strange affect on me.  Due to all the hours I spend
       on the computer trying to complete assignments, I very closely resemble this--<a href=""></a> 
       <img src="Picture5.jpg"/> .  
        <p>
            
      
        I am not a quitter, so I will continue on, even if it comes to 
       'this' <img src="frustration.gif"/> .

       I have spent numerous hours trying to figure out simple task.  I am a very calm
       and easy going person but Launch Code assignments have brought me to the brink of this
       behavior.

<h2>SIDEBAR</h2>
One of my assignments is to figure out how to use html entities.  I' m going to make this easy on myself.
<p>When I was in Europe I could spend both &pound (British pound) and &euro; (euro) while in Great Britian.  I still have some &euro; paper money.</p>
